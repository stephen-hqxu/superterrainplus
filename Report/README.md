# Academic Material

This directory contains a collection of the academic reports when the project was first done as a school project.

The LaTeX source are provided which mainly serve as backups; presentation slides and compiled documents are too large to be committed into the repository. Instead, they are shared separately and can be found [Here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1wYjwEhqgnwUqL2VtZIMXad3Inyycnejq?usp=sharing).

As you may have already noticed the project is documented and most writings are taken from inline documentations in the project source code, as well as issues and pull requests created by me.

Finally, please do not make contribution to this directory.
