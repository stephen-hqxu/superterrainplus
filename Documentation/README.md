# SuperTerrain+ Documentation

Welcome to *SuperTerrain+*, a procedural terrain engine.

The application is still in its rapid development stage, therefore documentations for a vast majority of features are absent.

All historical release notes are exported and can be found in [Changelog](https://github.com/stephen-hqxu/superterrainplus/tree/master/Documentation/Changelog). Recent version of release notes can be found instead in *GitHub Releases*.
