# Super Terrain +

# Overview
Super Terrain + (or STP in short) is a 3-D procedural terrain generation engine that incorporates natural physics-simulation. The main design dilemma of this engine is:
1. Realistic.
2. Real-time capable.
3. Procedural, random but deterministic.

> It was originally a fun project to help me on learning procedural generation but it's too amazing and I finally used it as my university research project.
