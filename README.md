# About the project :interrobang:
Super Terrain :mountain: :heavy_plus_sign: (or STP in short) is a 3-D procedural terrain generation engine that incorporates natural physics-simulation. The main design dilemma of this engine is:
1. Realistic.
2. Real-time capable.
3. Procedural, random but deterministic.

## Build With :bricks:
- [GLM](https://github.com/g-truc/glm)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/)
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/)
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)

Those libraries are available in my public repo :+1:

- [SIMPLE](https://github.com/stephen-hqxu/SIMPLE)
- [SglToolkit](https://github.com/stephen-hqxu/SglToolkit)
