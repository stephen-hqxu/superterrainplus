# Contributing to SuperTerrain+

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. I am absolutely glad to hear that you want to contribute something to *SuperTerrain+*. As a new project, there are still a significant number of places to be improved and worked on. All contributions made by everyone, from simple ones like fixing a typo in the documentation, to big improvement such as bug fix and new feature, are absolutely welcome and very much appreciated.

This document aims to provide you a helpful guideline for contributing to the project.

## Commit

If you have a brilliant idea, please fork this repository and create a pull request. The process is exactly the same as how most open source repositories are done.

1. Fork the repository.
1. Create and push a new branch to your fork.
1. Start your creation. Don't forget to push your commit to the new branch in your fork.
1. Open a pull request to merge into the master branch in the root repository.

When you are committing changes, briefly describe what has been achieved in this commit in the commit message. You might notice that I tend to prefix *emoji* before the message, and you don't have to repeat my approach, it just makes myself identifying what has been changed by the same commit easier; although you are absolutely welcome if you wish to.

As always, you are welcome to open an issue if you found something that does not work, or simply have any question.

## What's Next

I guess that's it, because this is a new project and the community is still small, so it might be better to be less restrictive. I will add more contribution guidelines in the future.
